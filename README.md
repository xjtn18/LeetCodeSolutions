# LeetCode Work Environment

# Instructions
- Run new-problem.sh ('source new-problem-env.sh') which accepts 2 arguments: -l (the problem language) and -n (the name of the problem) ( example: 'source new-problem.sh -l python -n prob1' )
- Any python testcases should be written in the testcases.txt file in the format 'input ::: expected'.
- Running the sol.py in python problem directories will test your code against the testcases and show you which cases you passed/failed.
- After you think your code is ready for submission, you can run the copySubmissionCode.py (with one argument to be the name of the problem directory you want submit) to automatically copy the Solution class from the sol.py of the given directory to your main clipboard. ( example: 'python copySubmissionCode.py problem1/' )
