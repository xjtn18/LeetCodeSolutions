# LeetCode Work Environment

# Instructions
- Run new-problem-env.sh ('source new-problem-env.sh') with one argument to be the name of the problem.
- This will create a new directory with the given name, along with a sol.py and testcases.txt inside.
- Sol.py's are created based on the template provided in 'template.txt'
- You will write all of your code in the Solution class.
- Any testcases should be written in the testcases.txt file in the format 'input ::: expected'.
- Running the sol.py will test your code against the testcases and show you which cases you passed/failed.
- After you think your code is ready for submission, you can run the copySubmissionCode.py (with one argument to be the name of the problem directory you want submit) to automatically copy the Solution class from the sol.py of the given directory. ( example: 'python copySubmissionCode.py problem1/' )
